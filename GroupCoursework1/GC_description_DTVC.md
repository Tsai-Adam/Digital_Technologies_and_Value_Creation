# Group Assignment – DTVC

**Instructor:** Dr. Philippe Blaettchen

## Objective

Explore how data collection can support decision-making for a new or existing small business. This assignment focuses on using web scraping and APIs to collect and analyze real-world data, applied to an industry of your choice.

## Scenario

Imagine you are consulting for a small business or launching a new venture. Your goal is to understand the market, competition, or customer preferences. Data will be your primary tool for uncovering actionable insights.

## Instructions

### 1. Define Your Business Context
- Select an industry or business idea (e.g., sustainable clothing, artisanal coffee shops, local tourism, fitness services).
- Clearly define the main question(s) your analysis will aim to answer (e.g., optimal pricing, competitive positioning, customer segmentation).

### 2. Research Planning
- Identify potential data sources (e.g., competitor websites, product review platforms, public directories, relevant APIs).
- Outline a research plan:
    - Key analyses you will perform
    - Specific data points to collect
    - Relevance of these data points to your business questions

### 3. Data Collection Strategy
- Develop a strategy to gather data using:
    - Web scraping tools (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Selenium, or advanced scrapers)
    - APIs for structured data
    - A mix of both, with an emphasis on scraping
- Prioritize sources based on relevance and ease of collection

### 4. Pipeline Development
- Build a pipeline to:
    - Collect raw data
    - Clean and preprocess the data
    - Engineer relevant features
- Your pipeline should produce one or more clean DataFrames ready for analysis
- Generate a lexicon for the DataFrame(s), including columns for feature names, descriptions, and units

### 5. Analysis and Insights
- Use Python to perform:
    - Summary statistics
    - Visualizations
    - Preliminary analyses addressing your business questions
- Highlight key findings and potential implications for the business

### 6. Presentation
- Record a 10–12-minute video presentation summarizing:
    - Business context and main questions
    - Research process
    - Data and insights collected
    - Recommendations for the business, highlighting how data and analysis support your answers

## Deliverables

1. **Code Submission**
    - All Python code for scraping, cleaning, and analyzing data
    - README file if necessary
    - Code should be well-commented, executable, and understandable by a non-expert

2. **Video Presentation**
    - Upload the video to a cloud platform (e.g., private YouTube link)
    - Use slides or visual aids as needed
    - Provide the video link as part of your submission

## Assessment Criteria

1. **Use of Data Collection Techniques (20%)**  
   Effective and appropriate application of scraping and API skills

2. **Quality of Research Plan and Execution (20%)**
